# GAN Image Generation AI

Welcome! 👋  
This project is an AI based on **GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)** for image generation.

## 🚀 About
This AI is built entirely **from scratch**. To start generating images, you'll first need to **train** it using images placed in the [`meta`](./meta) folder.  
We recommend adding **many images** to improve the quality of the AI's output!

## 📦 Installation
First, install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow
```

## 🛠️ Usage
Once the packages are installed, you can start training your AI by running:

```bash
python index.py
```

And that's it! Your AI will begin training automatically.

## 🧩 License
This project is **open-source** and free for everyone.  
You are welcome to **use, modify, and distribute** it as you wish — no restrictions!

Made with love ❤️
